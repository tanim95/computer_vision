# Computer Vision Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a computer vision project.

## Description

The project aims to implement various computer vision techniques to solve a specific problem or achieve a particular goal such as image classification, object detection, image segmentation.

## Features

- PROJECT_1: VIRTUAL PAINT: in this project we use live camera feed to draw a virtual line.

- PROJECT_2: This is a Python project that uses hand tracking with the help of MediaPipe library to control the system volume based on hand gestures.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/tanim95/computer_vision.git

2. Install the required libraries using pip: For instance pip install mediapipe or python -m pip install mediapipe

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- Pycaw
- Comtypes

This will install all the necessary dependencies for these project.

## Usage

project 1:

Position yourself in front of the camera.
Raise your hand and open your palm to start tracking.
Move your hand up or down to control the system volume.
The volume level will be indicated by a green rectangle on the right side of the screen.
To exit the application, press the 'q' key.
